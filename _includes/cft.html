                ElixirConfÂ® EU Virtual 2020 is an online two-track conference with 30-minute speaking slots with optional Q&A. The event will run from 2pm to 7pm CEST (8am EDT to 1pm EDT) on both days.<br/>
            We are looking for speakers with Elixir-centric content and also speakers who can bring pragmatic and practical knowledge into their Elixir talks. It doesn't matter if you are new to Elixir or have multiple years on a core team. We look forward to what you can share with the global Elixir community.
