Gabor was introduced to Erlang during his university studies by participating in the RefactorErl group. He was interested in language design and a lot of academic problems, so this project was an excellent opportunity to get into type systems and other projects. From there, he joined Ericsson Hungary in 2011 to work on telephony switches (mostly on the famous one mentioned in Joeâ€™s book). This taught Gabor to enjoy the complexity of this application.

This was the point when Gabor started loving working with legacy code and learned how to work in a team. After three and a half years, he joined a research project inside Ericsson where he was exposed to Executable UML and testing strategies. In 2015, Gabor joined Erlang Solutions where he has been working with different clients (e.g. backbone financial payment solutions) as well as internal products like WombatOAM. Gabor's main professional interests are language design, architecture and math.

Gabor likes drawing and painting, watching science fiction movies and series, he is a big Doctor Who fan.
