audience: Intermediate

Media processing has never been a piece of cake - a large amount of data, tons of different formats, protocols and standards, growing latency and quality requirements. In this talk, weâ€™ll introduce you to the world of media streaming via Membrane Framework - our solution for dealing with multimedia without pain. The framework provides a set of so-called elements, which are composable blocks implementing different multimedia processing operations. The talk will be based on the real use cases of the framework and will explain - what are use cases for such a framework - what are the benefits of using such a framework in comparison to other solutions, - what is the roadmap for the framework, especially in terms of supporting WebRTC.
