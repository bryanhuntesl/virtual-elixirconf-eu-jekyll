Property testing is a tool that every Elixir developer should have in their toolbox. Come learn how property tests can thoroughly test a problem space and make bulletproof software. We'll look at properties pulled from the Oban background job processor. Some examples we'll explore: 

* Proving a CRON parser 
* Checking concurrent uniqueness 
* Transitioning between migrations 
* Proving system reliability 

You'll leave armed with the ability to recognise situations where properties are more effective than example based tests.
