Background processing is at the heart of many production systems. Processing media, analyzing data and running reports are business critical jobs and must be treated with the same guarantees as any production data. Oban is a background processor that treats jobs like critical data. Come learn how it was born of frustration with fragile systems and grew to combine streams with transactional database support. You'll leave with a deep understanding of the challenges Oban aimed to solve and how it succeeded.

  
This talk is a historical tour of the challenges and frustrations that prompted Oban, and the technical solutions it adopted to solve those challenges. It will show how OTP fundamentals, core Elixir libraries and modern PostgreSQL combined to provide an approachable but highly robust library for processing background jobs.
