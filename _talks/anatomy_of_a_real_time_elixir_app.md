In this session, Stephen will show us how a real-time Elixir app worksâ€”from client to server. What does it mean to have a "real-time" web application? What communication layers can be used (WebSocket, SSE) and how are they used in real-time apps? How does a JavaScript client connect to the server? How does the Elixir server work, and what makes it great for real-time apps? This talk includes snippets of much of the code that powers Channels (and also LiveView), so you can see how it works first-hand.
